I'm passionate about technology that makes electronics more open, approachable, and accessible to everyone.

I spent most of my career working as a hardware design engineer specializing in embedded systems designed for the Internet of Things. More recently, I took a hiatus from design work and pivoted into a product management role at a PCB assembly manufacturing startup.

Currently, I'm bootstrapping [Common Ground Electronics](https://cgnd.dev/), a boutique embedded systems engineering services firm.
