It's been a little while since I've posted anything new, but that doesn't mean I've been resting on my laurels!

Here's a quick update on what I've been up to, including links to what I've been writing recently üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

# Starting Common Ground Electronics

Back in November of 2022, I started working on [Common Ground Electronics LLC](https://cgnd.dev/) and was actively looking for my first consulting client.

Serendipitously, I ran across [a post](https://chaos.social/@chris_gammell/109389167641322097) from [Chris Gammell](https://chrisgammell.com/) announcing a free developer training that [Golioth](https://golioth.io/) would be offering the following month. At the time, I had no previous experience working with Zephyr or Golioth, but this seemed like a good introduction to both‚Äìso I signed up!

Chris and I chatted after the training and he asked if I was interested in doing some contract engineering work for the developer relations team at Golioth. It had been a while since I worked on anything IoT related, so I was excited to work with the Golioth team and [get back to working on embedded systems](https://x.com/chrismakesstuff/status/1527045357414191104).

# Working for Golioth

This month wraps up just over a year doing contract work for Golioth, so it seems like a good time for a quick retrospective.

Over the past year, I built and documented a [series of reference designs](https://projects.golioth.io) intended to help jumpstart new IoT product designs using the Golioth Firmware SDK. This also included spearheading Golioth's [Follow-Along Hardware](https://blog.golioth.io/instantly-recreate-sophisticated-iot-designs-with-follow-along-hardware/) initiative to support building reference designs with widely available off-the-shelf hardware. There's a nice summary discussion of a couple of of the things I worked on in this [partner webinar with Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89Q4VwlqrJk).

In addition, I helped the Golioth DevRel team to run their [monthly Zephyr training](https://golioth.io/training-signup) introducing new developers to Zephyr and Golioth. This was fun to be a part of the same training that introduced me to Zephyr and Golioth in the first place!

A big part of [Demo Culture at Golioth](https://blog.golioth.io/demo-culture-at-golioth/) is blogging about what you're working on. Zephyr has a pretty steep learning curve and I found myself frequently referencing the Golioth blog for guidance on a variety of Zephyr-related topics. Over my time working with Golioth, I was able to write nearly a dozen articles for their blog, ranging in topic from [debugging](https://blog.golioth.io/debugging-nrf9160-zephyr-applications-with-ozone/) to [managing board revisions.

# Looking forward

In addition to authoring technical content for clients, I'm also starting to write about embedded systems and IoT-related topics on the [Common Ground Electronics blog](https://cgnd.dev/posts/). So far, I've written about how to [enforce Zephyr code quality with pre-commit](https://cgnd.dev/posts/enforce-zephyr-code-quality-pre-commit/) and my experience [prototyping a WiFi serial logger with Golioth](https://cgnd.dev/posts/golioth-wifi-serial-logger-prototype/).

If you're interested in hiring me for technical writing (or other embedded systems related work), feel free to [reach out](https://cgnd.dev/contact/).
