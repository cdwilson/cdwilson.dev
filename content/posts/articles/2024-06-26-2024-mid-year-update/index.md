It's been a little while since I've posted anything new here, but that doesn't mean I've been resting on my laurels!

Here's what (and where) I've been writing recently üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

# Content for clients

Over the last year, I've been doing some Zephyr-related technical writing for the [Golioth blog](https://blog.golioth.io/).

You can see the full list of articles I've contributed at https://blog.golioth.io/author/cdwilson/

# Common Ground Electronics

In addition to authoring technical content for clients, I'm also starting to write about embedded systems and IoT-related topics on the [Common Ground Electronics blog](https://cgnd.dev/posts/). So far, I've written about how to [enforce Zephyr code quality with pre-commit](https://cgnd.dev/posts/enforce-zephyr-code-quality-pre-commit/) and my experience [prototyping a WiFi serial logger with Golioth](https://cgnd.dev/posts/golioth-wifi-serial-logger-prototype/). I also just posted a [mid-year retrospective](https://cgnd.dev/posts/2024-mid-year-retrospective/) where I talk about how the business was started and what I‚Äôve been working on over the last year.

# I can write for you too
