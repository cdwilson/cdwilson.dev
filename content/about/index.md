For most of my career, I've worked as a hardware design engineer 🤓 specializing in embedded systems 🤖

I've also worked as a product manager 📊 in electronics manufacturing 🏭

I'm passionate about building things that make electronics and manufacturing more approachable to everyone.

[Flying Camp Design](https://flyingcamp.design) is my electronics design consultancy where I design and manufacture open-source electronics.
