I'm passionate about building things that make electronics more approachable and accessible to everyone.

For most of my career, I've worked as a hardware design engineer 🤓 specializing in embedded systems 🤖

Over the last couple years, I took a hiatus from design and worked as a product manager 📊 in a PCBA manufacturing startup 🏭

[Flying Camp Design](https://flyingcamp.design) is my electronics design consultancy where I design and manufacture open-source electronics.

If for some reason you enjoy reading boring documents (or want to hire me), you can check out my [Résumé](https://cdwilson.github.io/resume/).
