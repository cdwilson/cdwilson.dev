I'm passionate about technology that makes electronics more approachable and accessible to everyone.

In my spare time, I'm bootstrapping [Common Ground Electronics](https://cgnd.dev/), a small electronics design consultancy.

I spent most of my career working as a hardware design engineer specializing in embedded systems designed for the Internet of Things.

Over the last couple years, I took a hiatus from design work and pivoted into a product management role at a PCB assembly manufacturing startup.

If for some reason you enjoy reading boring documents (or want to hire me), you can check out my [RÃ©sumÃ©](https://cdwilson.github.io/resume/).
