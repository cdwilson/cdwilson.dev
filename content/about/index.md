I'm passionate about technology that makes electronics more approachable and accessible to everyone.

In my spare time, I'm bootstrapping [Common Ground Electronics](https://cgnd.dev/), a small electronics design consultancy.

I spent most of my career working as a hardware design engineer specializing in embedded systems.

Over the last couple years, I took a hiatus from design and pivoted into a product management role in PCBA manufacturing.

If for some reason you enjoy reading boring documents (or want to hire me), you can check out my [Résumé](https://cdwilson.github.io/resume/).
